## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```code
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ robots.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- `src/pages/`: Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in this directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

- `src/components/`: Astro & React components should be placed in this directory.

- `public/`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in this directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command      | Action                                      |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------|
